International Cake Day
======================

My friends and I recently created a holiday amongst ourselves called International Cake Day. Basically, about thirty of us got together and backed and decorated about fifteen cakes in a day. Then, we shared it amongst ourselves and our neighbors. It was super fun; you can check out the facebook event page [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1456381854611534/?fref=ts). Just for fun, my friend Nikki and I created a CakeDay web app that would allow users to share virtual cakes online. 

##Includes:
